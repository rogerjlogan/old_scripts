===================================================================================
Changes incorporated in VER8_R1_0:
3/14/2009:
Modified how muxpins get generated. For WaveSet and EdgeSet the non-mux and mux
waveforms will be separated and the muxpin will get null actions.
In the case of EdgeSetDelay this will depend on ChanFirst, ChanSecond selectors, 
ChanFirst is even, ChanSecond is odd data.

5/3/2009:
Changed MUXPINS to MUXSECPINS to be more clear.

5/15/2009:
The following were fixed: scan translation. Some issues with big loops. Forced_CPM patterns.
Documentation updated. Released as VER8_R1_0
===========================================================
Changes in VER8_R1_1 (from VER8_R1_0 2009/05/18):

added new reference file: "translation_patref.txt" which logs all the
  pattern references.

5/31/2009:
Added chksum detection.
Added support for processing acdata_markers.p.
Moved some of the unimportant prints to the translation_status.txt

6/7/2009:
Added support for CycleSet not just CycleSetMD.
Improved pin checking of pinlist.txt against cycleSet statements.

6/8/2009:
cycletbl_mod.mod8 can now have pins which are not in the patterns. This is for the case
  when the cycletbl has pins which don't exist in the VectorMap. VectorMap is validated against
  pinlist.txt. Any non-pattern pins have a '.' in the FIELD[] statement. These pins MUST exist
  at the end of the pinlist.txt file!

6/9/2009:
Fixed problems with shutdown vectors. in VER8_R1_0, shutdown vectors were causing the translator
  to exit prematurely. Now, at least for parallel patterns, shutdowns are correctly processed. In
  the case of DPM patterns the only thing done is they are converted and included at the top of the
  pattern in a comment. The user may want to copy these to the end of the pattern for a "final state"
  if this is important. The choice was made not to automatically pad the patterns. For CPM patterns,
  if shutdown vectors exist, they will be used on all microinstruction lines. translation_status.txt
  will have a statement similar to:
  "RM[JTEBYPASS3Pattern.proc][DEF_WFT] remapped to [ALLOFFCycle]shut=[Y]" if shutdowns are used.

Fix power supply assignments for new adapters in pol2fus.py.
6/11/2009:
In some programs mset=0 and/or dsets=0 are used (specifically in subroutines). In polaris
  this means use the prior mset and/or dset value. Translation was modified for both
  parallel and scan to implement this as well as preset all unset mset/dset to 1 and all
  unset iset to zero. This was seen in the 'c022' program.
Changed how 'X' or 'X' is treated in vector fields. If there is an x/X in the vector (or the mdiset)
  the field will be padded out to the correct number of characters. Validated this in 'c022' program.

6/13/2009:
Created new program 'DESUB'. This program will replace subroutines in patterns. See notes above.
Also, fixed PRE_PROC to remove spaces from within vectors.

6/14/2009:
Modified how fields are processed. Instead of preallocating the desired numbers of pins it processes
	 whatever is there and prepads them with zeros. This should help with some of the mismatches.
	 It does print some advisories if it sees something it thinks is strange, it no longer aborts in
	 those situations though.
Made some fixes to DESUB to advise about match loop subroutines. It happily adds any requested
	 match subroutines given to the patterns but it will log an error telling you this will force CPM.
	 see HOWTO notes.
Added a print to translation_errors.txt if CPM patterns exceed 4000 vectors. Nothing is done to fix
	 the size, fixing it is left to the user.
Fixed some issues with CPM microinstructions not getting properly processed by VCP.

6/16/2009:
Changed MUXSECPINS to MUXSECONDARYPINS and changed (%s)*MUXSECPINS to %s-MUXPRIMARYPINS. This
	will avoid pattern compiler problems. User will need to create both pingroups.
Modified processing of 'div' to try and avoid issues in cellnames.
Fixed some issues in cell processing where first edges were getting lost (Driveoffs). Also,
	added some "undecoded edges" and fixed some crash issues due to dimensions of 
	"wfcelllist" in purge_actable.
7/28/2009:
Found issue with VectorMapSetCycleAll processing when "fields" were used and there were scan pins.
This was causing pin out of order messages. Scan headers now correctly ignored for this...

8/18/2009:
Vectors with only one field were creating empty vectors in expand_vectors. This was due to the 6/14/2009
fixes. Made expand_vectors() copy the vector over if there is only one field and return.
Separated Changes into separate Changelog.txt file (instead of in VER8_INSTRUCTIONS.txt).


===================================================================================
Changes in VER8_R2_rc0 (from VER8_R1_1 2009/05/18):
01/09/2010

Lots of little bug fixes in waveforms and patterns.

Added checksums of individual 'C' code files to pattern & waveform conversion files.

Major changes to support multicycle windows (evX2 mode). (320C40,320C32,etc)

Added a means to "remember" prior vector data state. (to support multicycle)

Added new alias assignment section to separate DRVSTRBOFF, separate from the individual
driveoff and strobeoff sections. Continue drive is now different from continue strobe and
"hold state".

Added support for multipin scan (more than one scanin/out pair,F240).

Found issue with repeat forever in scan. It was writing this out as a
scanautogen. Re-enabled CPM-calling-DPM scan to fix this. (Note that this is
not presently supported on FX2-32ch mode). (C6203)

Seriously updated documentation. Provided more "HOWTOs".

Moved comments in scan header AFTER the header mode statements (320C50 or F240).

Fixed alias issues for 0/1/e/k/x/X (320C50).

Corrected some issues identified in the conversion of MissingEdge (array sizes, etc)

Removed some line wrapping "improvements" induced by one of the "pretty C" tools.

Pushed intermediate waveform generation files into a .Trash directory.

Added the -n option to GCT_GEN_MOD8 to prevent evX2 mode (multicycle) from being used.

Added log file for BUILD_INHERIT_MENU (BIM.log)

Added parameter processing for BUILD_INHERIT_MENU so it can be batched (or re-run based on BIM.log)

Added feature if BUILD_INHERIT_MENU can read translation_pat_ref.txt it will also add a 
PatternSequence with all Zipper Refs to the waveform inherit file.

Fixed an issue with continue waveforms where strobecontinue and drivecontinue were improperly mixed.

Identified a flaw in how continue waveforms were deciding whether to continue strobe or continue drive
(last cycle must be an open strobe).

Added a feature to remove mux pin waveforms and patterns at the users request.

In order to keep Buddy happy, all usage of tab characters have now been replaced with three spaces

Fixed a pre_proc issue which had a crash when a vector ended with a brace comment instead of a semicolon.
The assumption is the semicolon is implied otherwise one of these two vectors should be thrown out.
===========================================================
Changes in VER8_R2_rc1 2010/02/08):
Fixed an issue with out of sequence strobeoff/driveoff where
it was throwing out the driveoff event.
===========================================================
Changes in VER8_R2_rc2 2010/02/09):
Fixed a series issue in the pattern translation for Hex pattern
fields not a multiple of 4. dset/mset/vectors missing bits and
left as zero. (Thanks Buddy!)
===========================================================
Changes in VER8_R2_rc3 2010/02/09):
Fixed remaining issues with hold vectors.
Fixed various translation of evX2 patterns where the PUSHBACK vectors were all dots. (Thanks Brett!)
Continue Strobe also added in where needed.
Fixed some issues with CPM patterns, where microinstructions were place without vectors and
various other issues in that section.
Fixed issues with early CPM shutdowns (LDA etc). Should now correctly be using the WFTREF on those
vectors when shutdown is provided. Also now uses the shutdown vectors (if available).
Fixed some random crashes with a modified mod2 to mod8 file.
Validated some old scan conversions.
===========================================================
Changes in VER8_R2_rc6 2010/02/09):
Fixed segmentation faults with empty pingroups. Fixed issues in rc4,rc5 with this implementation.
Modified pingroup listing to recurse three times through the pinlist strings. This should now
properly parse situations like:

PinListSet(THISISEMPTY);
PinListSet(SUBGRP3A,LD4,LD5);
PinListSet(MYSUPERGRP,SUBGRP1,SUBGRP2);
PinListSet(SUBGRP1,LD0,LD1);
PinListSet(SUBGRP2,SUBGRP2A,SUBGRP3A);
PinListSet(SUBGRP2A,LD2,LD3);

Prior to this fix MYSUPERGRP wouldn't have had all its pins included...
===========================================================
Changes in VER8_R2_rc6 2010/02/09):
Found that EdgeSetDelay waveforms were being treated as EdgeSetDelayData waveforms.
EdgeSetDelay only has one set and should be almost the same as EdgeSet other than
including the delay parameter (the last one) times whatever the period variable is.
Fixed. Found with C758 device.

===========================================================
Changes in VER8_R2_rc7 edge_set_fixes....
===========================================================
Changes in VER8_R2_rc8
Missing Edge had some long waveform reference names. Increased MAXGCTLEN from 15 to 25 in VCP...
===========================================================
Changes in VER8_R2_rc9
Found some issues with subroutine inclusion of MSET/DSET/ISETS
Fixed pre_proc so xSETS in begin/end subsets would also be included (may affect more than just
subroutines). Also increased the allowable size of subroutine lines from 1000 to 10000
Fixed issues with substring names for subroutines. i.e. Reset and Do_Not_Reset
processed in that order would end up using Reset for both.
===========================================================
Changes in VER8_R2_rc10
Found issue in the scanset header statements where it was dropping the last character.
===========================================================
Changes in VER8_R2_rc11
reordered the check_for_match and check_for_repeat in pre_proc18_appn.c
Code for "repeat" was hitting before code for "match repeat". Check for match is now first...
Fixed issue with FLAG(CONT ON) not expanding vector
Fixed issue with $_end label in evX2 mode not aligned.
Added support for simple loops in scan patterns.
